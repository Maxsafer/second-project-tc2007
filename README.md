## Input
Each *3SAT* problem must be saved as a `.txt` file individually inside the `./problems` directory for the program to run properly in the following format:

**Note**: There are 2 spaces between the number of variables and number of clauses in `line 2`, and there are 2 spaces in the first clause of the 3SAT problem (`line 3`). 

When parsing the document, the first two lines are ignored and the parsing begins from there, until the `%` is found which ends parsing. Each clause must be terminated by a `0` and a new line (`\n`).

## Sample Input
Several sample inputs are provided in the `./problems` directory:
* `uf20-02.txt`
* `uf20-03.txt`
* `uf20-04.txt`
* `uf20-05.txt`
* `uf20-06.txt`
* `uf20-07.txt`
* `uf20-08.txt`
* `uf20-09.txt`
* `uf20-10.txt`
* `uf20-11.txt`
* `uf20-12.txt`
* `uf20-13.txt`
* `uf20-14.txt`
* `uf20-15.txt`
* `uf20-16.txt`
* `uf20-17.txt`
* `uf20-18.txt`
* `uf20-19.txt`
* `uf20-20.txt`

## Output
This program will output a 0 if the algorithm did not manage to find a solution for the 3SAT problem or the binary string that solves the 3SAT problem if the solution for the 3SAT problem was found. 

In addition, it will output a file into the `./solutions` directory with the steps it followed even if it did not found a solution, named as follows: `solution_problemfilename.txt`.

This program also graphs an output, saved in the `./graphs` directory with the name related to the test file.

## Sample Output
A sample output for `uf20-15.txt` has been saved in `./solutions` directory. The output looks as follows:
